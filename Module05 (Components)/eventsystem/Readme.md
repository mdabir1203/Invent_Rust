Game Development:
In a game, different components (e.g., player, enemies, power-ups) can listen to events like "player_died", "enemy_spawned", or "power_up_collected". This allows for loose coupling between components and makes it easy to add or remove features.
GUI Frameworks:
In a graphical user interface (GUI) framework, components like buttons, text fields, and windows can listen to events like "button_clicked", "text_changed", or "window_resized". This enables modular and reusable GUI components.
Real-time Data Processing:
In a real-time data processing system, different modules can listen to events like "new_data_available", "data_processed", or "error_occurred". This allows for efficient and scalable processing of large datasets.
IoT Systems:
In an Internet of Things (IoT) system, devices can listen to events like "sensor_data_updated", "device_connected", or "alert_triggered". This enables modular and scalable IoT systems.
Web Applications:
In a web application, different components (e.g., login, chat, notifications) can listen to events like "user_logged_in", "new_message_received", or "notification_sent". This allows for modular and reusable web application components.

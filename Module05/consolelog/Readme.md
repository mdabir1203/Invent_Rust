The modular logging system can be used in various scenarios where different logging strategies might be required. For example:

Console Logging: As shown in the example, logging messages to the console.
File Logging: You can create another struct that implements LogStrategy to log messages to a file.
Remote Logging: Another implementation could send logs to a remote server.



// Different File logging Example 
``
use std::fs::OpenOptions;
use std::io::Write;

pub struct FileLog {
    file_path: String,
}

impl FileLog {
    pub fn new(file_path: String) -> Self {
        FileLog { file_path }
    }
}

impl LogStrategy for FileLog {
    fn log(&self, message: &str) {
        let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
            .create(true)
            .append(true)
            .open(&self.file_path)
            .unwrap();
        writeln!(file, "{}", message).unwrap();
    }
}``

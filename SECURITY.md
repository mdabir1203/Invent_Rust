# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We maintain security updates for the following versions of Rust Modular Projects:

| Version | Supported          | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| 1.2.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current stable release |
| 1.1.x   | :white_check_mark: | Extended support |
| 1.0.x   | :x:               | End of life |
| < 1.0   | :x:               | Development versions |

## Security Updates

- Patches for security vulnerabilities are provided for all supported versions
- Critical updates are released as soon as possible
- Non-critical updates are bundled with regular releases

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please follow these steps to report a vulnerability:

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email your findings to [md.abir1203@gmail.com]
3. Encrypt sensitive information using our [PGP key](link-to-pgp-key)

### What to Include

- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

You can expect:

1. **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
2. **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 10 business days
4. **Fix Implementation**: Timeline provided based on severity

### Severity Levels

We classify vulnerabilities according to the following criteria:

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Critical | Remote code execution, data breach | 24-48 hours |
| High | Authentication bypass, data corruption | 3-5 days |
| Medium | Information disclosure, DoS | 7-14 days |
| Low | Minor issues, edge cases | Next release cycle |

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Code Security**
   - Use safe Rust practices
   - Avoid `unsafe` blocks unless absolutely necessary
   - Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regular `cargo audit` checks
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use version pinning for critical dependencies

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Security test coverage
   - Fuzz testing for parsing operations
   - Regular penetration testing

### For Users

1. **Installation Security**
   - Verify package signatures
   - Use official release channels
   - Check SHA-256 hashes

2. **Configuration Security**
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Use secure defaults
   - Regular security audits

## Disclosure Policy

1. **Private Disclosure**
   - Security issues are handled privately
   - CVE assignments when applicable
   - Coordinated disclosure with affected parties

2. **Public Disclosure**
   - After patch release
   - Full disclosure in security advisory
   - Credit to reporters (if desired)

## Security Features

Our security features include:

- Memory safety through Rust's ownership system
- Safe concurrent programming practices
